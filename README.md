Introduction:

The goal of this project was to create a simulated medical device in C. For this project we are using a Texas Instruments Stellaris EKI-LM3S8962 development board with a ARM Cortex-M3 v7M microcomputer and coding in the IAR programming environment (IDE) (version 8.210). Our team also used Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 for source control management with Github. With some of the hardware related methods, our team will be using  a combination of the tasks that are used in the example stellaris projects to access specific pins, ports, LCD screen, and other available hardware on the Stellaris board..
